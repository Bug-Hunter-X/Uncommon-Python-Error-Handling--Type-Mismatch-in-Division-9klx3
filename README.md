This repository contains a Python function that demonstrates an uncommon error-handling situation.  The function `function_with_uncommon_error` divides two numbers, but it handles cases where the divisor is zero and also cases where input types are unexpected, leading to type errors that are not always immediately obvious. The solution improves the error handling by providing more specific error messages, improving readability and debugging.
